There are 2 available users in the database:

user: admin@elder.com
pass: admin

or

user: user@elder.com
pass: user

Accessing with admin user you can create, update, view and delete a product. On the other hand if you enter with another user, you will only be able to create a new product and see a product info.
You can create more users using insomnia (or other similar tool) via this API:
